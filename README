Deployer Groove makes it easy to concatenate multiple javascripts in order without having a build step in development.  Put the line 

```javascript
require(<path to file>);
```

in your javascript files.  When you run 

```
dg <path to javascript> <output file>
```

all the require calls will be replaced with the javascript file.  To remove the build step for development, include the function defined in header.js in your javascript.

Options
-o --output - the file to write the output to.  defaults to stdout
-u --uncompressed - do not compress the output
-s --startFilename FILENAME - a file to include at the start of the output. first non-flag argument will be used
-e --endFilename FILENAME - a file to include at the end of the output. second non-flag argument will be used
-C --config FILENAME - a config file with the options to use
-l --lint - lint the input files
