Deployer Groove makes it easy to concatenate multiple javascripts in order without having a build step in development.  Put the line

```javascript
require(<path from web root to file>, [<path>, <path>]);
```

in your javascript files.  When you run

```
dg <path to javascript> [<path>, <path>]
```

all the require calls will be replaced with the javascript file.  To remove the build step for development, include the function defined in header.js in your javascript, updating staticUrl with the web root path.

Options
-o --output - the file to write the output to.  Defaults to stdout
-u --uncompressed - do not compress the output
-l --lint - lint the input files
-h --help - write the help to stdout and exit
